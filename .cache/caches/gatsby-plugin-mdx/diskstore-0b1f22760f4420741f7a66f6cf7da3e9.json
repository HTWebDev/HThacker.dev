It took a little longer than I expected to finish but I'm really proud of it and I learned a lot. I originally planed for it to be a relateively simple website to show off my skills as a developer. This was drawn out a bit as I kept finding new ways to improve on the design and eventually started adding animations. This lead to learning how to use Framer-Motion and GSAP.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"framer-motion\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}><a parentName=\"h3\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#framer-motion\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"framer motion permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n      }}><svg parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n          \"focusable\": \"false\",\n          \"height\": \"16\",\n          \"version\": \"1.1\",\n          \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n          \"width\": \"16\"\n        }}><path parentName=\"svg\" {...{\n            \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n            \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n          }}></path></svg></a>{`Framer-Motion`}</h3>\n    <ExtLink link=\"https://www.framer.com/api/motion/\" newTab mdxType=\"ExtLink\">Framer-Motion</ExtLink> is a Framer animation library API. \"Framer provides helpers for advanced physics-based animation, complex touch-based gestures and common components for scrolling, paging and interface flows.\"\n    <p>{`This was the first animation library I tried and I was amazed at how simple it was to use. It really streamlines the process of simple animations; buttons, state changes, Etc. Usually animations can be done using only CSS but it can be a lengthy and sometimes complicated process to write out all of the CSS. Of course the better smoother animations use Javascript... which can take even more lines than CSS to solve. Framer-Motion fixes that.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I did however run into some problems later on. Not with Framer-Motion itself but the realistic scope of it. Framer-Motion was built for mostly simple animations, \"Start Here, Move Here, Expand when this happens...\" however when more orchestrated animations need to be done thats where GSAP came in. I was trying to build a component where two hands with are moving in on one another from opposite sides of the screen. A \"Cheers\" animation. I was able to somewhat build it in Framer-Motion. But I wanted it to be timed using the users scrolling position on the page. I later learned that I needed to level up to a much beefier and robust library.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"gsap-greensock\",\n      \"style\": {\n        \"position\": \"relative\"\n      }\n    }}><a parentName=\"h3\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"#gsap-greensock\",\n        \"aria-label\": \"gsap greensock permalink\",\n        \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n      }}><svg parentName=\"a\" {...{\n          \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n          \"focusable\": \"false\",\n          \"height\": \"16\",\n          \"version\": \"1.1\",\n          \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n          \"width\": \"16\"\n        }}><path parentName=\"svg\" {...{\n            \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n            \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n          }}></path></svg></a>{`GSAP (GreenSock)`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Using `}<ExtLink link=\"https://greensock.com/\" newTab mdxType=\"ExtLink\">{`GSAP`}</ExtLink>{` was an exciting experience.
